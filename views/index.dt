        h2 What is Surlicious?
        p Surlicious is a tool to monitor the uptime from online services. The twist on Surlicious is the way the monitoring takes place. Your online service has to ping Surlicious in 5 minute periods. If so called "heartbeats" are missing, you get a email alert. That's it. Easy as cake!

        h2 How to use Surlicious?
        p 
            | In the 
            a(href="/documentation") documentation 
            | menu point you can read how to setup Surlicious. But it only boils down to sending a POST request every 5 minutes at a given endpoint.
